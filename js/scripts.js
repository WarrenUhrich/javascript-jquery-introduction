/**
 * Using jQuery!
 * NOTE: The "$" is a regular character. It can be used in a variable
 *       or function name the same as any regular letter. The jQuery
 *       developers programmed jQuery all under one function called
 *       jQuery(). Because it is annoying to type jQuery all the time
 *       they decided to do "$ = jQuery" so you could use the "$" by
 *       itself as a shorthand!
